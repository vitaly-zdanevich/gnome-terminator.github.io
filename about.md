This is a fork of the original Terminator. In short, the maintainers seem to have given up and haven't worked on the project for years, and a new team wanted to continue the work of the original authors. More info [here](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator/issues/1) and [here](https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator#new-home-on-github).
